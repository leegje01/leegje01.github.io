                 <li>Wrestling- Wrestling is what brought me to Luther. It keeps me in good shape both physically and mentally. I believe it has shaped me into the person I am today.</li>

                  <li>Business-I love to read about what is going on in the business world. During the year I read the WSJ and other business articles. Alongside that I enjoy reading an assortment of businees/entreprenuership magazines.</li> 
                  <li>Biograhies-Reading the biography of Warren Buffett changed my outlook on life. Such a successful and wealthy person, yet so humble an modest. His success with stocks isn't to shabby either.</li>
