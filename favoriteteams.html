             <ul id=ul>Yankees:
                 <li>Though the common assumption when it comes to Yankee fans is the bandwagon assumption, I have been a Yankee fan all my life. Starting from the tender age of five, when I was drafted to the Apache Junction Little Leage Yankees I have had a love for the Blue and White Pinstripes. I felt a deep pain watching the last at bat for Derek Jeter this past week. #legend</li>

             <ul id=ul> The Heat:
                  <li>I enjoy watching the Heat only for the entertainment of seeing a stacked team of atheltes outperform other teams. I am purely a bandwagon fan when it comes to the Heat. Now that Lebron has left I think I may find something better to do with my time.</li>
